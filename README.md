# Intro

Getting to know the [symfony framework](http://github.com/symfony/symfony)

# Examples
The 01-http example is introducing, http request and response and the front controller
The example is slightly enhanced from the one in the [official documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html)

# Running the examples

## Change directory to the example folder

    cd \path\to\example

> for the first example this would be `cd 01-http`

## Update Framework Dependencies

    composer install

## Start a web server
For simplicity the built-in php web server introduced in PHP 5.4 will be used.

    php -S localhost:8000

## Run the site!
